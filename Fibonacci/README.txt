//Program calculates the Fibonacci sequence to a given index inputted by the user.
//If the user inputs an index that pushes the Fibonacci sequence beyond the range
//of unsigned int, the program will notice and stop the sequence at that threshold
//The program will then calculate the Fibonacci sequence using the esimation method
//and the matrix method

//@pre program must be run in the command line
//@file prog2.cpp
